        <div id="divn1">
            <p>There is small information about ASUS history</p>
            <pre>        1. Founding (1989):
            Asus was founded in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1989 by four former
            Acer engineers - T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, M.T. Liao, and Wayne Hsieh.
            The name "Asus" is derived from the mythical winged horse "Pegasus."

        2. Early Years (1989-1990s):
            Asus started as a motherboard manufacturing company, producing
             motherboards for other computer companies.
            In the early 1990s, Asus began designing and manufacturing graphics
             cards, eventually becoming one of the top graphics card manufacturers.

        3. Expansion and Diversification (1990s-2000s):           
            Asus expanded its product range to include laptops, desktops,
            servers, networking equipment, and various computer components.
            The company gained a reputation for producing high-quality
            motherboards and graphics cards, earning recognition from 
            enthusiasts and professionals in the tech industry.

        4. Brand Growth (2000s-Present):
            In the mid-2000s, Asus focused on building its own brand, 
            launching a wide range of consumer products under the Asus name.
            The "Republic of Gamers" (ROG) brand, introduced in 2006,
            marked Asus's commitment to gaming hardware, including 
            high-performance gaming laptops, motherboards, and graphics cards.</pre>
